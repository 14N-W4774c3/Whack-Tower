## Overview
Our game project is about a tower-climbing game with fixed camera angles. This is an experiment to test how to make fixed multiple perspectives fun in a short platforming game.
In our game, the player ascends a tall tower by jumping on platforms.  While doing this, they have to contend with balls falling from above, and more importantly with limited camera angles. The randomly-spawning falling balls launch the player off the tower - falling off causes the player to respawn at the bottom. The prototype uses thirteen fixed camera angles, which can be swapped between via the left and right control keys. Some are initially views looking up the tower; many look down at the platforms the player is traversing. The cameras also have a limited amount of rotation, and have the ability to zoom in. The game ends once the player reaches the green platform about halfway up the tower.

## Usage
